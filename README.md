# Homework-No.-5.-Computer-Geometry

This project is an application made in QT Creator. 
It applies different algorithms to draw geometry; you can also apply rotation and translation.

You can clone directory and open pro file inside Qt.
If you created the project by using another Qt Creator instance, Qt Creator asks whether you want to use the old settings. The settings are specific to the development environment, and should not be copied from one environment to another. Therefore, we recommend that you click No and enter the information again in the Configure Project tab.

The Configure Project tab displays a list of kits for building and running projects, that are installed on the development PC and configured in Tools > Options > Build & Run > Kits. Select the kits that you want to build and run the project with.

To run the project press the play button.
The user interface is straight foreward so you shouldn´t have any major issues using the GUI.
